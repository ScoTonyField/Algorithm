# Experiment of Backtracking

â€‹	In this session, we test the algorithm into 3 dimensional to analyze the complexity, i.e. Kinds, Number of row, Number of col, maximum steps, running times.

- Running Times Test

Running times is set as 100 per parameter changes to decrease the influence of random-generated matrix.
